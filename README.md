**DESCRIPTION**:  Software Testing Internship – Web Application Testing

During my internship in the software testing domain, I had the opportunity to work on the testing of a web application for an e-commerce platform. The project aimed to ensure that the web application was free of defects, functioned smoothly, and provided an optimal user experience. My role primarily involved manual and automation testing of the application, with a particular focus on functional, regression, and performance testing.

**Project Overview and Objectives**:
The e-commerce web application was designed to handle a wide variety of user interactions, including product browsing, cart management, user login, payment processing, and order tracking. The goal of the testing project was to verify that all features worked as expected, identify any bugs or performance issues, and ensure the overall usability and stability of the application under different conditions.

**Tools and Technologies Used**:
Selenium WebDriver: For automation testing, Selenium WebDriver was the primary tool used. Selenium provided the capability to automate repetitive test cases, especially in regression testing scenarios. I used it to write scripts for simulating user interactions such as logging in, adding products to the cart, checking out, and verifying the correctness of product prices and availability. The automation scripts were written in Java, and I used Eclipse as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). The use of Selenium helped reduce the time spent on manual testing and ensured that the same test scenarios could be repeated easily whenever code changes were made.

**Jira** : Bug tracking and defect management were done using Jira. It was used to report, track, and manage the defects found during both manual and automated testing. Each defect was thoroughly documented with steps to reproduce, screenshots, and logs, providing the development team with enough detail to resolve issues quickly. Bugzilla was also used in some cases for logging issues and ensuring traceability from discovery to resolution

**Postman**: For testing the application’s APIs, I used Postman. The web application interacted with multiple backend services, and Postman allowed me to send requests to these APIs, validate the responses, and check for any inconsistencies in the data flow. API testing was crucial in ensuring that the integration between the front end and back end worked seamlessly, particularly for functions like payment gateway integration and user authentication

**Git and GitHub**: Version control was handled using Git, and the code repository was hosted on GitHub. This ensured that our test scripts, especially automation scripts, were managed efficiently and could be updated in parallel with the development team's codebase. We also used Git to synchronize test scripts with the CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins.

**Project Workflow and Resource Gathering**:
The first step in the project was to understand the requirements of the e-commerce application by reviewing functional specification documents, user stories, and wireframes. The resources for testing, including the test case documentation and test data, were gathered from these sources. We also held meetings with the product owners and developers to clarify any ambiguous requirements.
The testing process began with the creation of detailed test cases based on the application’s features. I worked with the QA team to write test cases that covered all possible user journeys, including edge cases and error scenarios. These test cases were organized and managed in TestRail, a test management tool that provided a structured approach for tracking test case execution and defects.

**Execution and Results**:
During the execution phase, I conducted both manual and automated testing. Automated tests were run first, followed by manual exploratory testing. The automated test scripts covered essential workflows such as user registration, product search, cart management, and payment gateway functionality. As part of manual testing, I performed exploratory testing to uncover any issues that might have been missed during the automated phase. I also carried out compatibility testing across different browsers to ensure consistent functionality.
Throughout the testing process, I logged any defects in Jira and Bugzilla, including detailed steps to reproduce, screenshots, and error logs. Each defect was prioritized based on its severity and impact on the application’s functionality.
Once the tests were completed, the results were shared with the development team. Automated test execution reports, generated by TestNG, and performance test results, obtained from JMeter, provided clear insights into the application's stability and performance. After addressing the critical defects, the final round of regression testing confirmed that the issues had been resolved.

**Outcome**:
By the end of the project, the e-commerce application was thoroughly tested across multiple environments and devices. We were able to identify and resolve several high-priority defects, including UI inconsistencies, functional errors in the checkout process, and performance bottlenecks under heavy load. The collaboration with the development team and the use of automation tools significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of the testing process. The application was successfully released to production with improved quality, ensuring a seamless experience for users.
In conclusion, my internship project provided valuable exposure to real-world testing tools and methodologies, enhancing my skills in both manual and automated testing while contributing to the overall success of the project.
